        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mushroom risotto is a creamy Italian rice with chicken broth and your favorite mushrooms. You can make it on the stovetop with a little patience and meditative stirring.

            You can’t make risotto with any old rice. The high starch content of risotto rices creates that creamy texture when cooked.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 cups flavorful mushrooms (such as shiitake, chanterelle, or oyster), cleaned, trimmed, and cut into 1/2- to 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2/3 cup brandy, vermouth, or dry white wine</li>
            <li>5 to 6 cups chicken stock (use vegetable stock for vegetarian option)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup shallots</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups risotto rice</li>
            <li>1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley or chives</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring stock to a simmer in a saucepan.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a wide saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and shallots and sauté about 5 minutes (if using chanterelles, dry sauté first for a minute or two, and let the mushrooms cook in their own juices before adding the butter).</li>
            <li>Add the rice and stir to combine. Add brandy, bring to a boil, and reduce liquid by half, about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 1/2 cup of stock at a time, stirring enough to keep the rice from sticking to the edges of the pan. Stir the rice almost constantly — stirring sloughs off the starch from the rice, making the creamy sauce you're looking for in a risotto.

                Wait until the stock is almost completely absorbed before adding the next 1/2 cup.
                
                This process will take about 25 minutes. The rice should be just cooked and slightly chewy.</li>
            <li>Stir in the Parmesan cheese, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or chives.</li>
        </ol>
